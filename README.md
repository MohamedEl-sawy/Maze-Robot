# Maze-Robot
is a maze-solving robot. The first version (V1) operates with a rule-based system, making decisions using sensors. The second version (V2) uses machine learning (Q-learning) to learn from past moves, optimizing its path over time. V2 improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary turns and dead-ends, making navigation smarter.
